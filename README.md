# PRODIGY_WD_03
Here are five key things I learned from this Tic Tac Toe project:

Game logic structure**: Managing game state, checking for winners, and switching turns can be cleanly handled using arrays and functions.
AI decision-making**: Even a basic AI can appear intelligent by prioritizing winning, blocking, or random moves.
Accessibility**: Using ARIA roles and labels makes the game more inclusive for screen reader users.
Responsive UI with CSS Grid**: A 3x3 board layout is easily created and adapted to different screen sizes using `grid-template-columns`.
Event-driven interaction**: JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation provide a smooth, interactive experience for players.
Thank you prodigy for constant support and new opportunities.
